## Goal
Standardize CLI commands using Command pattern

## Tasks
- [ ] create src/controller/commands/base_command.py
- [ ] define execute() contract
- [ ] decide what commands return (string, result object, etc.) and document it

## Verify
IngestCommand can subclass BaseCommand cleanly

## Done when
Command interface exists and is consistent
